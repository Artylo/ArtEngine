# ArtEngine
Hand-made video game engine based on SDL2 and OpenGL, and written in C++

## License
ArtEngine and its derrived products is currently under exclusive copyright. This means nobody else can copy, distribute, or modify the licensed material without being at risk of take-downs or my personal ire. You may view the source code at your leasure, as it is provided publicly, but you shouldn't copy, distribute, or modify it in any way not explicitly outlined in this license. I support the creation of alternatives, which uniquely differ from this project. I am also permitting that the licensed material may be used and modified in private, but it cannot be derrived from and used for commercial purposes. All private use ought to be marked with some sort of disclosure as to the origins of the source.

### Your options and permissions:

- Do not copy the code wholesale.
- View the code and use it as inspiration for your own projects.
- Use and modify the code in private projects, but with attribution and not for commercial use.
- Find or create a unique alternative that is under an open source license.
- Negotiate a private license.

and alternatively:

- Donâ€™t use the software. 

### My Reasons:

ArtEngine is currently a hobby project of mine. As such it is created by me and me alone. It is also not at a state where I feel currently comfortable sharing its ownership with anyone else, outside of providing a public viewfinder, through which you may freely look at its source code to track my progress and verify that it is trustworthy software. Perhaps one day when it is substantially more feature-rich and of interest to the general public, I will consider a more permissive open-source license. I understand that as is this might be better served by just turning this into a private repository, but I would still like the code to be publicly  viewable. As it currently stands the available popular open-source licenses do not fulfil my needs, so I have somewhat bodged together (as all things in this project) this license, which I will tentatively name "transparent  source". i.e you may view the code, but you may not use it wholesale as is, outside of derriving some inspiration, creating your own alternative solution to the same problems, or using it for non-profit private projects.
